## Origin

I originally began developing a watchface for Dexcom/Diabetic users because the watch faces options could be improved. During development, I learned the Garmin SDK does not allow a Watch Face app to access the Dexcom Data Field. This is sad. I reached out to both Dexcom & Garmin. I got no response. 

Irregardless, I had already spent time w/ the Garmin SDK. I decided to at least publish my own watchface that fit my own Garmin watch + what I wanted for data. Enjoy!
